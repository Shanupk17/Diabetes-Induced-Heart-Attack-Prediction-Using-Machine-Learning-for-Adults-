Diabetes-Induced Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a high-accuracy machine learning model to predict heart attack risk in diabetic adults. By analyzing health parameters such as glucose levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits, the model aims to support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

üìå Project Objectives
Predict heart attack risk in diabetic individuals.

Improve early detection to reduce cardiovascular mortality.

Classify risk into Low, Moderate, or High levels.

Provide model interpretability using SHAP for trust and transparency.
